This repository contains Javascript code for 2D and 3D mathematical diagrams in HTML5 pages.  The 2D code works via the support for SVG that is built in to modern browsers.  The 3D code is built on top of the Babylon 3D graphics library and just adds an API that is more convenient for mathematics.  The code here was obtained by extracting and tidying up code from the [combinatorics diagrams](https://github.com/NeilStrickland/combinatorics_diagrams) and [algebraic topology diagrams](https://github.com/NeilStrickland/algtop_diagrams) repositories.  Those repositories will eventually be refactored to use this library.
